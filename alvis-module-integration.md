# Deploying a module into AlvisNLP

This document present meterials to integrate new modules into the Alvis engine. It is designed for application developers. The special skills required to better understand the contents of these guidelines are the Java, maven environment, and the XML language.

In the Alvis engine, the modules are detached from the core engine that manage their execution. A developer can thus add new modules to the Alvis engine, create access interfaces for the modules, and let users make use of their functionalities. 

In the following, different materials required are provided in order to deploy, integrate and run a module into the AlvisNLP engine.

1. [the module elements and conventions for to create a module](/alvis-module-elements-and-conventions.md): understand what meterials are needed to implement a module into Alvis. The tasks implied here are done by Java developers.
2. [the module is recognized and integrated into the AlvisNLP system](alvis-module-recognition-and-integration.md): understand how a implemented module is recognized, compiled and integrated into the Alvis System. Default configurations into Alvis enables the tasks be done automatically.
3. [the module into the system is loaded and executed](alvis-module-access-loading-and-execution.md) : undertand how a integrated module presented to users for execution. Developers make it understandable for end-users.

Note:- 1. presents the infrmation required to valid modules. 2. explains how valid modules are taken into charge by Alvis. 3. describes how users benefit from the module functionalities.

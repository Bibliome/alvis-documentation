# Deploying a module into AlvisNLP

This document present meterials to integrate new modules into the Alvis engine. It is intented to application developers. The special skills required to better understand the contents of these guidelines are: Java, maven environment, and the XML language.

In the Alvis engine, the modules are declouped from the core engine in a way that enbales to add new modules. You can thus create new a module, prepare its access interface, and let users make use of its functionalities through the Alvis engine.

In the following, materials required are provided:

1. [create a module](/alvis-module-elements-and-conventions.md): understand what elements and conventions are needed to implement a module into Alvis. The tasks implied here are done by Java developers.
2. [Alvis recognizes and integrates the module](alvis-module-recognition-and-integration.md): understand how a implemented module is recognized, compiled and integrated into the Alvis System. Default configurations into Alvis enables the tasks be done automatically.
3. [the module is loaded and executed](alvis-module-access-loading-and-execution.md) : undertand how a integrated module presented to users for execution. Developers make it understandable for end-users.

NOTE: 1. presents the infrmation required to valid modules. 2. explains how valid modules are taken into charge by Alvis. 3. describes how users benefit from the module functionalities.

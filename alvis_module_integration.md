# Integrate a module into AlvisNLP {#alvis-module-integration}

This document present meterials to integrate new modules into the Alvis engine. It is intented to application developers. The special skills required to better understand the contents of these guidelines are: Java, maven environment, and the XML language.

In the Alvis engine, the modules are declouped from the core engine in a way that enbales to add new modules. You can thus create new a module, prepare its access interface, and let users make use of its functionalities through the Alvis engine.

In the following, materials required are provided:

1. [create a module](/alvis_module_elements_and_conventions.md): understand what elements and conventions are needed to implement a module into Alvis. That presents requirement to obtain valid modules. The tasks implied here are done by Java developers.
2. [integrate a module source to AlvisNLP](alvis-module-recognition-and-integration.md): understand how a implemented module is integrated into the Alvis System. That explains how valid modules are taken into charge by Alvis.  Default configurations into Alvis enables the tasks be done automatically.
3. [the module is loaded and executed](alvis-module-access-loading-and-execution.md) : undertand how a integrated module presented to users for execution. That describes how users benefit from the module functionalities. Developers make it understandable for end-users.
